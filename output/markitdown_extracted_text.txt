Table Examples

Use tables to organize data not format information. Never use table for layout. Avoid
merging cells, split cells, nested within a cell, and blank cells. Simple tables are easier
to interpret for all students and screen readers.

An example of a simple table with header row and data.

Header 1
Data 1
Data 4

Header 2
Data 2
Data 5

Header 3
Data 3
Data 6

Example 1: Avoid use table for layout like this format without header row

Example 4: Table Color
Avoid using color as the only means to convey information. For example, in the table
below, the complete and incomplete items may appear the same to someone who is
color blind:

Best practices: A better option would be to provide another way of conveying
information not just color alone and screen readers:
