Table Examples 

Use tables to organize data not format information. Never use table for layout. Avoid 
merging cells, split cells, nested within a cell, and blank cells. Simple tables are easier 
to interpret for all students and screen readers.  

An example of a simple table with header row and data. 

Header 1 Header 2 Header 3 
Data 1 Data 2 Data 3 
Data 4 Data 5 Data 6 

 

Example 1: Avoid use table for layout like this format without header row

Example 2: Avoid merged cells “Grading Scale” 

Grading Scale 
Grade Points Percentage 
A + 960 - 1000 96 - 100% 
A 930 - 959 93 - 95% 
A - 900 - 929 90 - 92% 

 

Best Practices: Move the heading Grading Scale out of table instead of merging cells. 

Grading Scale 
Grade Points Percentage 
A plus 960 to 1000 96 to 100%

Grade Points Percentage 
A 930 to 959 93 to 95% 
A minus 900 to 929 90 to 92% 

Screen readers do not know whether - symbol is minus, hyphen, dash, en dash or em dash so it 
will not read it. 

 

Example 3: Avoid merged cells like this format

Example 4: Table Color 
Avoid using color as the only means to convey information. For example, in the table 
below, the complete and incomplete items may appear the same to someone who is 
color blind: 

20/20 vision: 

Project Due Date Completed 
Project 1 March 15, 2020 X 
Project 2 April 15, 2020 X 
Project 3 May 15, 2020 X 

 

Color blind: 

Project Due Date Completed 
Project 1 March 15, 2020 X 
Project 2 April 15, 2020 X 
Project 3 May 15, 2020 X 

 

Best practices: A better option would be to provide another way of conveying 
information not just color alone and screen readers: 

Project Due Date Completed 
Project 1 March 15, 2020 N or No 
Project 2 April 15, 2020 Y or Yes 
Project 3 May 15, 2020 Y or Yes
